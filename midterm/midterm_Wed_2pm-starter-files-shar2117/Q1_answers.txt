(a) Answer (YES or NO):

    If yes, explain how, and if no, explain why not:

    No, because the requirement for an initialiser method is that the
    representation invariants have to be enforced through a postcondition given
    the requirements of the Class Design Guideline.

    But if for some reason this was not the case and this was a bad class,
    the user would have to make sure to satisfy the precondition whenever
    the class is created, otherwise there would be no guarantee by the
    developer of the class methods working correctly.


(b) The docstring is:

    """Test that list.count will return the number of times integer v is
    present in the list when given a random number of integers
    """

    The function body is:

    counted_items = 0
    for item in lst:
        if item == v:
            counted_items += 1
    assert lst.count(v) == counted_items
